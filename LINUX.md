Well it looks like you found the easter egg ðŸ‘€ (or almost that) and like all people who always find easter eggs I should give you a gift, but what gift would I give you? hmm... already know! I will name this easter egg from LINUX.md on GitHub and as the name says, I will give you [a version of BetterCrewLink with Linux support temporarily for a limited time!](https://github.com/OhMyGuus/BetterCrewlink-Linux/releases/latest) ðŸ¥³ (To install this version just look at the "How to use" category)

Enjoy it and also if you find any bugs in this version report on [GitHub](https://github.com/OhMyGuus/BetterCrewlink-Linux/issues) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/qDqTzvj4SH) (specifically for [ThaGuus#2140](https://discordapp.com/users/508426414387757057)), by doing this you will be helping everyone in the BetterCrewLink community to make a CrewLink experience better! Thanks for trusting us! And if you don't have a Linux, I'm sorry but you won't get anything ðŸ˜¢, just a hug (lol)
