BetterCrewLink now officially supports other languages, that is, you can use BetterCrewLink without any problem of not understanding a part in English, but with that we need help with translations because nobody is born knowing everything languages.

Any translations you make are greatly appreciated.

There are two methods for this:

<details>
<summary> In GitHub </summary>

1. [Fork the Project](https://github.com/OhMyGuus/BetterCrewLink/fork).
2. Create your Translation Branch.
3. Go to static **->** locales **->** en **->** translation.json and Download this file.
4. Open the translation.json with your text editor of preference.
5. Edit the file but not edit this parts like: "gamehostonly", "inlobbyonly", just translate the text.
6. Create a folder with the acronym of your language that you translated with translation.json inside the folder.
7. Throw everything to your fork.
8. Open a Pull Request.
