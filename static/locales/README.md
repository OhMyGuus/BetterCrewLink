[![Crowdin][crowdin-shield]][crowdin-url]

BetterCrewLink now officially supports other languages, that is, you can use BetterCrewLink without any problem of not understanding a part in English, but with that we need help with translations because nobody is born knowing everything languages.

Any translations you make are greatly appreciated.

There are two methods.
