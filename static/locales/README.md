If you want to translate BetterCrewLink, use a file editor and start translating all the files, after translating, fork BetterCrewLink clicking in "Fork", go to that same folder and drag the files here, then click on "Confirm new file", after that click on "Pull requests" up there, click on "New pull request" and make a pull request and ready, after that and just wait for someone to accept your pull request and you will have contributed to the project, thank you so much!
