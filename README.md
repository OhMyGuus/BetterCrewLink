<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project implements proximity voice chat in Among Us. Everyone in an Among Us lobby with this program running will be able to communicate over voice in-game, with no third-party programs required. Spatial audio ensures that you can only hear people close to you.

<!-- INSTALLATION -->
## Installation

### Windows

Download the latest version from [releases](https://github.com/OhMyGuus/BetterCrewLink/releases/latest) and run the `BetterCrewLink-Setup-X.X.X.exe` file. You may get antivirus warnings, because this program hooks into the Among Us process to read game data.

### Linux

To install & run it on Linux run the following commands:

```
wget "https://mirror.bettercrewl.ink/pc/latest/BetterCrewlink-Linux.AppImage"
chmod +x BetterCrewlink-Linux.AppImage
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope
./BetterCrewlink-Linux.AppImage
```

The Linux version is thanks to the following contributors:

- [TheGreatMcPain](https://github.com/TheGreatMcPain) -> CrewLink fork, Keyboard watcher fork, memoryjs fork
- [zbanks](https://github.com/zbanks) -> Memoryjs fork
- [Donokami](https://github.com/Donokami) -> Testing and helping
