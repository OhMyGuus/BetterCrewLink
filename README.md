<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project implements proximity voice chat in Among Us. Everyone in an Among Us lobby with this program running will be able to communicate over voice in-game, with no third-party programs required. Spatial audio ensures that you can only hear people close to you.

## Installation

## Windows

Download the latest version from [releases](https://github.com/OhMyGuus/BetterCrewLink/releases/latest) and run the `BetterCrewLink-Setup-X.X.X.exe` file. You may get antivirus warnings, because this program hooks into the Among Us process to read game data.

## Linux
